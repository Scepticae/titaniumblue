          <p>
            TitaniumBlue consults with clients using a number of collaborative tools. We can consult with the client
            over the phone, using live video chat, or traditional in-person meetings. During the meeting, we will
            discuss
            all the details needed for your application or website. TitaniumBlue uses flowchart software to put the
            details into a cohesive structure for project planning. Once a plan is in place, a mockup of the project is
            created using Figma allowing the client to look over the design and place comments directly on the
            page reflecting any changes needed. After the mockup revisions have been made and the application design is
            satisfactory to the client the actual development will begin.

          <p>
            During development, the project will
            go through a versioning process. With each version, the customer will test the application for discrepencies
            and add or remove functionality. The versioning process will continue until a version satisfies the client.
            At this point, the application will be finalized and moved to its permanent location specified by the
            consumer. After the project has been fully completed, the client will recieve an invoice describing the work
            completed and the amount due. The client does not pay until the project is finished and satisfactory.
